# Usaco-Bronze-Practice-Java
All my code starting off from when I began practicing Usaco Java
Started learning Java at an early age but gave up cuz it was too advanced. I picked it up in June 12th, 2020 when I took my first Java class from Hui Quan at AGCWS I believe. He goes by Kevin and he really inspired me to start my coding journey with his funny lectures. P.S. this was COVID Year I believe.
